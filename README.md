# RBP_EWCE_analysis
This analysis was run by Melissa Grant-Peters to verify cell type specificity of gene lists of interest identified by Sonia Garcia-Ruiz in the Splicing noise study. This analysis was performed locally on an installation of R version 4.2.0. Loaded packages and corresponding versions are listed in the folder 'processed-data'. 
The reference drop-seq data from multiple cortical regions (Allen Brain Atlas) was prepared by Regina Reynolds (RHReynolds) as described in detail in the methods of the paper.
